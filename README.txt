Title: HIV Protease Prediction Project
Author: Collin Leonard

DESCRIPTION: 

The goal of this project is to perform machine learning technique to predict the binary result of the cleavage site, 
by of maximizing accuracy of prediction (while accounting for the specificity and sensitivity). 
The F_2 or balance accuracy metrics will be used to quanitify this goal.
